- Create a sphere with indicies.
- Wrap a 2D texture around the sphere.
- Rotate the sphere.
- Using a heightmap image, have two textures wrap the sphere, choosing which one is used based on the heightmap values
- Generate heightmap(s) that can dissolve and condense areas in real-time.
- Add displacement to the sphere, much like making waves.

- Texture alpha in fragment shader based on vertex difference compared to original
- Simulate instability and then stabalize

Any order:
- Particle effects?
- Light emission from one of the textures?
- God rays?
